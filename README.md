Enhancing Drug Side Effect Prediction with Explainable AI for Medical Health Applications
This project aims to improve the prediction of potential drug side effects using machine learning and explainable AI techniques. It is built to assist healthcare professionals and patients by offering interpretable predictions based on patient medical data.

🚀 Project Overview
In the healthcare sector, predicting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is vital for safe treatment. This project uses AI models to predict side effects of prescribed drugs and integrates explainable AI (XAI) techniques (like SHAP) to ensure transparency and interpretability of the predictions.

🎯 Objectives
Predict potential side effects of drugs based on patient data.

Provide explanations for predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

Build a simple and interactive user interface using Streamlit.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn – For data processing and model training

SHAP – For explainability

Streamlit – For building the frontend

Matplotlib / Seaborn – For data visualization

📊 Sample Output
Predicts side effects such as nausea, dizziness, allergic reaction, etc.

Provides SHAP plots to explain which features (e.g., age, weight, other conditions) contributed most to the prediction.

💡 Use Case
This tool can be integrated into e-health systems, helping:

Doctors to make informed prescriptions.

Patients to better understand potential drug risks.

🔍 Future Work
Expand dataset to include more diverse patient demographics.

Integrate with electronic health record (EHR) systems.

Enhance UI with advanced visualization.
